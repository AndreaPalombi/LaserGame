# LaserGame
In this game the player must avoid bouncing lasers. The longer he survives, the higher the score. 
It is also possible to purchase boosts to facilitate the game, consuming points.
This game supports two mode: Normal and Hard.

With small code changes (guide in the program comments) you can add other players, and change the difficulty by modifying the spawn of enemies.

All musics within the game are open licence.
